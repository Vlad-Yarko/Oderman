# If you clone this repository, you need to do your .env file

Of course, to start use it, you also need install all requirements
```commandline
pip freeze requirements.txt
```

# I did not do any comments, but I think that everything is clear, and you won't be in trouble

# To start application, you need open terminal in your IDE or other way and be on your root directory.
So, after you did all requirements above, you need to write this command to start application:
```commandline
hypercorn main:asgi_app
```

# So, good luck!
